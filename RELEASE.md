## What's Included?

Refer to the [README.md](./README.md) and the [API Reference Guide](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/lin/html/index.html) for a complete description of the LIN Middleware.

## Known issues/limitations
LIN middleware 1.0 is designed to work with the mtb-hal-cat2 v1.x releases.
mtb-hal-cat2 version 2.x is incompatible with LIN 1.0 middleware. To use
LIN 1.0, downgrade the mtb-hal-cat2 version to 1.x. The versions of the used
libraries are configured on the Libraries tab of the Library Manager.
