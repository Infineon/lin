# LIN Middleware Library

## Overview

The LIN middleware implements a slave node for the PSoC 4000S, PSoC 4100S,
PSoC 4100S Plus, PSoC 4500S, and PSoC 4100S Max devices.

## Features

* Full LIN 2.2 Slave Node implementation
* Compliance with ISO 17987 specification
* Full transport layer support
* Automatic baud rate synchronization
* Automatic detection of bus inactivity
* Fully implements a Diagnostic Class I Slave Node
* Supports implementation of Diagnostic Class II and III Slave Node
* Full error detection
* Automatic configuration services

## Quick Start
